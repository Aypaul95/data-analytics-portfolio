“I built a Payroll & Compensation Analysis dashboard in Power BI. The project analyzes company payroll data to provide insights on monthly payroll costs, department expenses, average salaries by role, overtime, gender pay gaps, and salary equity.
I used four tables: payroll, employees, departments, and job_roles. Payroll is the fact table, and the others are dimensions. Relationships replaced SQL joins. I created DAX measures like Total Payroll Cost, Average Base Salary, Total Overtime Cost, and Department Avg Salary.
The dashboard includes line charts, bar charts, tables, and conditional formatting to highlight insights. Slicers allow HR to filter by department, job role, employment type, and date.
This dashboard helps HR identify high-cost departments, detect payroll issues, benchmark salaries, and ensure fair pay, enabling data-driven workforce decisions.”
