“I generated a realistic HR payroll dataset (1,000 employees, 10,000 payroll records)
 using SQL Server to simulate African HR startup environments. I designed the data to support payroll accuracy, 
salary equity, overtime analysis, and operational reporting, and modeled it for Power BI dashboards.”
