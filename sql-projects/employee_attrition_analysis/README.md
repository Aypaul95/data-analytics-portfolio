PROJECT: Employee Lifecycle, Attrition & Retention Analysis

(Critical for HR analytics teams)

🎯 Business Problem

“Why are employees leaving, when, and from which departments?”

HR startups sell retention insights to companies.

📊 What You’ll Analyze

Hiring vs exit trends

Attrition rate by:

Department

Role

Tenure

Location

Probation vs confirmed staff exits

High-risk departments

“I analyzed employee lifecycle data using SQL to track probation, confirmation, and exits. 
I calculated attrition rates, early-stage churn, tenure before exit, and department-level retention risks, 
and modeled the outputs for Power BI dashboards used by HR leadership.”
