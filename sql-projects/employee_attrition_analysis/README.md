PROJECT: Employee Lifecycle, Attrition & Retention Analysis

(Critical for HR analytics teams)

 Business Problem

“Why are employees leaving, when, and from which departments?”

HR startups sell retention insights to companies.

 What You’ll Analyze

Hiring vs exit trends

Attrition rate by:

Department

Role

Tenure

Location

Probation vs confirmed staff exits

High-risk departments

“I analyzed employee lifecycle data using SQL to track probation, confirmation, and exits. 
I calculated attrition rates, early-stage churn, tenure before exit, and department-level retention risks, 
and modeled the outputs for Power BI dashboards used by HR leadership.”
