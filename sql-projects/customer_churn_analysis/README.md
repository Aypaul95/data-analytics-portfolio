Customer Churn Analysis (SQL + Power BI)

Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn for a SaaS/Telecom-style business to understand why customers leave, when they leave, and how usage behavior affects retention.

The goal is to provide data-driven insights that help reduce churn and improve customer lifetime value.



Business Questions Answered

What is the overall and monthly churn rate?

Which subscription plans churn the most?

How does customer usage relate to churn?

How long do customers stay active after signup?

What are the main reasons customers leave?



Dataset Description

The analysis uses a relational data model with 1,000 customers:

customers – customer demographics and signup details

subscriptions – plan type, pricing, and billing information

usage – product usage and engagement metrics

churn – churn events and reasons

Data was generated in SQL Server (SSMS) with clear numerical differences for strong visualization in Power BI.
